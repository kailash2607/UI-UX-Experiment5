# UI-UX-Experiment5

## Aim:
To Present 2 different UX project scenarios (e.g., designing a health app, an e-commerce site, or a government service portal).
## Algorithm:
The UX design algorithm begins by identifying target user groups, such as first-time applicants, young professionals, and senior citizens, to ensure the design addresses diverse user needs. User pain points are then collected through methods like interviews, surveys, and contextual observations, uncovering challenges such as confusing navigation, unclear instructions, document upload errors, and poor status tracking.

Next, UX problem statements are formulated using the structured template:
“[User] needs a way to [achieve goal] because [obstacle], which results in [impact].”
These statements help define the core usability issues and guide design priorities.

Appropriate research methods—including interviews for qualitative insights, surveys for quantitative validation, and usability testing for evaluating interface effectiveness—are selected and applied.

Based on these findings, detailed user personas are created to represent key audience segments, capturing demographics, goals, behaviors, motivations, and frustrations.

Finally, design solutions are conceptualized, prototyped, and tested iteratively, leading to improvements such as simplified forms, clear document upload instructions, transparent application tracking, and actionable user recommendations. The process ensures a user-centered, accessible, and efficient experience across all design scenarios.
